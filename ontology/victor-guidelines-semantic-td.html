        This document provides a series of guidelines to annotate Thing Description (TD) documents
        with RDF statements containing external vocabularies. The following assertions are made
        throughout the document:
        <ul>
          <li>
            'Thing' identifiers should be non-dereferenceable IRIs (e.g. URNs).
          </li>
          <li>
            'Thing'-specific entities should be identified by IRIs relative to the identifier of
            a 'thing'.
          </li>
          <li>
            The definition of properties, actions and events should be consistent over a TD and
            follow one of the following design patterns: actions-only, properties-only, events-only.
          </li>
          <li>
            WoT scripts should use semantic annotations only, for reusability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vendor-specific vocabularies should be published on the Semantic Web as RDFS or OWL
            vocabularies.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Identifiers and References for Linked Data</h2>
        
      <p>
        The primary purpose of semantic annotations in a Thing Description (TD) is to increase
        knowledge of the general context in which a connected device operates. A common practice
        in this regard is to integrate TD documents of various origins in a single knowledge base,
        augmented with external knowledge, and run logical inference to infer new statements, which
        would not follow from TDs taken individually. In this integration process, identifying
        'things' and other physical world entities is crucial.
      </p>
      
      <section id="thing-identifiers">
        <h3>Identifying Things with IRIs</h3>
        
        <p>
          Every 'thing' on the Internet of Things (IoT) must be identifiable to be part of the network.
          Identification can be as simple as providing an IP address to all digital appliances but
          the original concept of the IoT, as developed by Kevin Ashton, includes other mechanisms,
          especially Radio-frequency identification (RFID). RFID allows any inanimate object (any
          'thing') to be uniquely identifiable if tagged with e.g. an NFC chip. RFID is the digital
          counterpart to bar codes, in the physical domain.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          However, RFID tags or bar codes are only containers for digital identifiers and do not
          guarantee uniqueness by themselves. Similarly, any communication-specific identifier like an
          IP address cannot offer a global identification scheme for physical world entities. The Web,
          on the other hand, provides a well-defined mechanism to identify 'things': the Uniform
          Resource Identifier (URI) and its internationalized extension, the IRI. Therefore, 'things'
          on the Web of Things (WoT) must be identified by IRIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The TD model includes the mandatory field <code>id</code>, interpreted
          as an IRI, but no further constraint is imposed on what IRI to use. It is important, however,
          to distinguish between the Web resource that represents the physical world entity (the
          'thing') and the Web resource describing this entity (a TD document). For instance, a TD has
          a format like any digital document but a physical device has not. Similarly, a physical
          'thing' has a geographical location but its TD has not, as a virtual entity. Finally, TD
          documents must have dereferenceable IRIs (e.g. via HTTP, CoAP or MQTT) but 'things' may not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clear guidelines exist for the naming of physical world entities on the Semantic Web
          [[cooluris]]. The two main approaches rely on HTTP URIs, either by using URI fragments in
          a resource that includes formal definitions for several entities (an ontology), or by using
          303 redirection to redirect to another document describing the entity, like a TD. In the
          context of WoT, associating a Web server to all 'things' on the Web server might come with
          scalability, security and lifecycle management issues. Another approach, which should be the
          favored approach in WoT, is to use alternative non-dereferenceable URI schemes, such as
          <code>urn</code>. A non-exhaustive list of URI schemes and URN namespaces compatible with WoT
          is provided below.

        <p class="note" title="Non-dereferenceable IRIs & Linked Data">
          The use of non-dereferenceable IRIs does not contradict the general Linked Data principles:
          all entities identified as per these guidelines must be semantically linked to a dereferenceable
          URI. The identifier of a 'thing' has necessarily been communicated to a Web client via a
          TD, whose URI had been known first. For property, action and event objects, it is required
          that they all link to a <code>Form</code> object, which contains a dereferenceable URI.

        <h3>Identifying Entities Relative to a Thing</h3>
        
        <p>
          The distinction that exists between a 'thing' and its TD also exists for any entity inherent
          to this 'thing' (e.g. its properties, the actions it can perform and the events it generates).
          For instance, the temperature property of a sensor is distinct from the Web resource to
          access to get a numeric representation of this property. In the following example, the
          temperature entity is not identified by <code>coap://example.org/temp-sensor-1-val</code>
          directly (wich represents a single temperature measurement, localized in time) but by the
          URN <code>urn:example:temp-sensor-1-val</code> (time-independent).
        </p>
        
        <pre class="example" title="Thing Description for a temperature sensor">
{
  "id": "urn:example:temp_sensor_1",
  "properties": {
    "urn:example:temp_sensor_1_val": {
      "type": "number",
      "forms": [{
        "href": "coap://example.org/temp_sensor_1_val"
      }]
    }
  }
}
        </pre>
        
        <!-- valid TD? No restriction on property label? -->
        
        <p>
          Although the TD presented in this example is a valid TD, it is cumbersome to give distinct IRI
          to all entities of a TD. Instead, it is possible to define all IRIs in the document as relative
          to the <code>id</code> of a 'thing'. These IRIs can then be resolved as absolute IRIs by
          applying the generic URI resolution algorithm [[RFC3986]]. For instance, the relative IRI
          <code>val</code> would resolve as <code>urn:example:temp_sensor_1/val</code>, in the
          following example.
        </p>
        
        <pre class="example" title="Thing Description for a temperature sensor (with relative IRI)">
{
  "id": "urn:example:temp_sensor_1",
  "properties": {
    "val": {
      "type": "number",
      "forms": [{
        "href": "coap://example.org/temp_sensor_1_val"
      }]
    }
  }
}
        </pre>
        
        <p>
          The default JSON-LD <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/td.jsonld">TD context</a> has been defined
          in such a way that a JSON-LD processor will, by default, interpret all keys for properties,
          actions and events as relative IRIs if they are plain JSON terms. WoT developers are indeed
          encouraged to use relative IRIs in TD documents, for the sake of conciseness.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The URI resolution algorithm applies to all URIs, which includes all URN namespaces. By
          default, if a URN namespace does not define any path section, a relative path is appended at
          the end of the base resource name and represents a distinct resource [[RFC8141]] (Section 4.3).
          However, according to the same specification, IRI fragments are not a distinctive part of a
          URN. If <code>urn:example:temp_sensor_1/val</code> is distinct from
          <code>urn:example:temp_sensor_1</code>, the URN <code>urn:example:temp_sensor_1#val</code>
          is equivalent to it. For this reason, hash IRIs are discouraged in TD documents.

      <section id="ld-integration">
        <h3>Linked Data Integration: An Example</h3>
        
        <p>
          In the context of data integration between multiple sources of knowledge, IRIs can be seen as
          database keys, where each source of knowledge is a database segment. That is, a desired effect
          when merging the different sources is that joins occur between statements that involve the
          same IRIs. Here, we provide an example in the domain of Building Automation Systems (BAS),
          where sensing devices for a large building expose TD documents that are integrated with
          infrastructure data, represented in RDF.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          One of the current trends in BAS engineering is to gather technical data on a building at
          different phases and of different nature under a single Building Information Model (BIM). The
          design of a BIM is a good use case for RDF and Linked Data, as various experiments conducted
          by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/">W3C Linked Building Data (LBD) community
          group</a> show. It is, for instance, a common practice to link data about automation devices
          with the geometry of the building, geolocation and weather information to optimize energy
          consumption.
        </p>
        
        <figure id="ld-integration-bas">
          TODO
          <figcaption>Linked Data integration of TDs with a BIM.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          Let us assume that a BAS includes two devices in the same room, each identified by a GTIN
          (product code and serial number). One is a temperature sensor and the other is a radiator
          with digital control. Moreover, information about the geometry of the room and the heating
          circuit to which it is connected is available. See example below (JSON-LD context omitted).
        </p>
        
        <pre class="example" title="Different knowledge sources in a BIM">
// temperature sensor TD
{
  "id": "urn:epc:...",
  "@type": "?",
  "properties": {
    "temp" : {
      "@type": "?",
      "type": "number",
      "forms": []
    }
  }
}

// radiator control TD
{
  "id": "urn:epc:...",
  "@type": "?",
  "properties": {
    "state": {
      "@type": "?",
      "writable": true,
      "type": "boolean",
      "forms": []
    }
  }
}

// room geometry
TODO

// heating circuit information
TODO
        </pre>
        
        <p>
          The JSON-LD definitions above do not share any identifier. However, as soon as devices are
          commissioned in a given room, the following statements can be added to the knowledge base.
          As a result, all entities become interlinked and inference can be applied to the whole
          knowledge base.
        </p>
        
        <pre class="example" title="Integration statements linking different knowledge sources">
[{
  "@id": "urn:epc:",
  "schema:location": "tag:SODA1R465__ART"
}, {
  "@id": "urn:epc:...",
  "schema:location": "tag:SODA1R465__ART"
}]
        </pre>
        
        <p>
          A common practice in BAS engineering is to interact with certain physical world entities as
          if they were 'virtual' digital devices. For instance, a room can be attached a temperature
          value, which would be the aggregated measurement of all temperature sensors located in that
          room. This rule can be captured by logical axioms and inference would lead to
          <code>tag:...</code> being a instance of the class <code>Thing</code> and having the
          property <code>temp</code> (see below).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Inference can also be used to know to what parts of a BAS newly commissioned devices should
          interact with. For instance, the knowledge base can contain a rule stating that all
          temperature-related devices in a room should interact with the boiler serving connected to
          that specific room via a heating circuit. Semantically, it could expressed as follows: the
          heating system that includes the boiler <code>urn:...</code> also has
          <code>urn:epc:...</code> and <code>urn:epc:...</code> as sub-systems (as defined below).
        </p>
        
        <pre class="example" title="Inferred statements">
[{
  "@id": "tag:...",
  "@type": "Thing",
  "properties": ["urn:epc:.../temp"]
}, {
  "@id": "",
  "ssn:hasSubSystem": ["urn:epc:...", "urn:epc:"]
}]
        </pre>
        
        <p>
          These inferred statements could only be inferred from a knowledge base made of links between
          entities and thus, the proper use of IRIs for 'things' is a necessary condition to the
          semantic processing of TDs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The BAS example we provide in this document can easily translate in the domain of industry
          automation (integration with an assembly line description) or city infrastructure management
          (integration with a city map). In these two domains, <a href="http://hypercat.io/">Hypercat</a>
          is a standard comparable to and, to some extent, embeddable in the W3C TD model. Integration
          with external knowledge bases is one of the use cases of Hypercat.
