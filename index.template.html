  <p>
  This document describes a formal model and a common representation 
  for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. 
  A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, 
  where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that 
  provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. 
  Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary 
  that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and 
  to allow diverse applications to interoperate. 
  Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in a JSON format that also allows
  JSON-LD processing. The latter provides a powerful foundation to represent
  knowledge about Things in a machine-understandable way.
  A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted 
  externally when a Thing has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) 
  or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted 
  with a Thing Description.

  <section id="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  The Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in the W3C Web of
  Things (WoT) and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing
  (much like the <i>index.html</i> of a Web site).
  The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself,
  an interaction model based on WoT's <code>Properties</code>,
  <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm, 
  a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, 
  and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Properties can be used for sensing and controlling parameters,
  such as getting the current value or setting an operation state.
  Actions model invocation of physical (and hence time-consuming) processes,
  but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. 
  Events are used for the push model of communication where notifications,
  discrete events, or streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver.
  In general, the TD provides metadata for different communication bindings 
  identified by URI schemes (e.g., "http", "coap", "mqtt", etc.),
  content types (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor",
  "application/exi" etc.), and security mechanisms (for authentication,
  authorization, confidentiality, etc.).
  Serialization of TD instances is based on JSON and includes at least 
  the TD core vocabulary as JSON names as defined in this specification document.
  </p>
  <p>
  Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in such a JSON serializiation and
  depicts WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>,
  and <code>Events</code> paradigm 
  by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.

            }]
        }
    }
}
</pre>
  <p>
  Based on this content, 
  we know there exists one <code>Property</code> interaction resource 
  with the name <i>status</i>. 
  In addition, 
  information is provided to indicate that this Property is accessible via 
  (the secure form of) the HTTP protocol with a GET method 
  at the URI <code>https://mylamp.example.com/status</code> 
  (announced within the <code>forms</code> structure by the 
  <code>href</code> name), and will return a string status value.
  The use of the GET method is not stated explicitly, 
  but is one of the default assumptions defined by this document.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a similar manner, an <code>Action</code> is specified to toggle the
  switch status using the POST method applied to the 
  <code>https://mylamp.example.com/toggle</code> resource,
  where POST is again a default assumption for invoking Actions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <code>Event</code> pattern enables a mechanism for asynchronous messages
  to be sent by a Thing.
  Here, a subscription to be notified upon a possible overheating event 
  of the lamp can be obtained by using the HTTP with its long polling
  sub-protocol at <code>https://mylamp.example.com/oh</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This example also specifies the <code>basic</code> security scheme, 
  requiring a username and password for access.
  Note that a security scheme is first given a name in a 
  <code>securityDefinition</code> and then activated by specifying
  that name in a <code>security</code> section.
  In combination with the use of the HTTP protocol this example
  demonstrates the use of HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Specification of at least one security scheme at the top level is mandatory,
  and gives the default access requirements for every resource.
  However, security schemes can also be specified per-interaction or per-form,
  with lower-level configurations overriding higher-level ones,
  allowing for the specification of fine-grained access control.
  It is also possible to use a special <code>nosec</code> security scheme to
  indicate that no access control mechanisms are used.
  Additional examples will be provided later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The TD in Example 1 reflects some additional defined default assumptions 
  that are not explicitly described. 
  For example, the content type of the 
  exchange format of the interactions is assumed to be JSON 
  (=<code>contentType</code>) and the <code>Property</code> <i>status</i> 
  resource is not <code>readOnly</code> as well as not <code>observable</code>. 
  Specifically, 
  the TD specification defines vocabulary terms 
  (<code>readOnly</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>contentType</code>) 
  that have default values. 
  If these vocabulary terms are not explicitly used in a Thing Description 
  instance, 
  the Thing Description processor follows default assumptions for 
  interpretation as defined in this specification.
  </p>

  <p>
  The TD can be also processed as an RDF-based model. 
  In that case, the Thing Description instance needs to be transformed
  into valid JSON-LD first.  
  In terms of JSON-LD 1.1 serialization, 
  the open-world assumption of RDF semantic processing requires vocabulary terms
  with default values to be always present explicitly in the instances. 
  Example 2 shows the same TD in a JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation representing
  exactly the same information as in Example 1; however, default values
  have been filled in.

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Generic WoT terminology is defined in [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]: 
  <dfn data-lt="Things">Thing</dfn>, 
  <dfn data-lt="Thing Descriptions">Thing Description</dfn> 
    (in short <dfn>TD</dfn>), 
  <dfn>Web of Things</dfn> (in short <b><i>WoT</i></b>),  
  <dfn>WoT Interface</dfn> etc.

  <section>
  <h1>Namespaces</h1>
  <p>
  The namespace for the W3C TD vocabulary as defined in 
  this document is <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/td">http://www.w3.org/ns/td</a>. 
  </p> 
  <p>
  Using content negotiation,  this namespace serves either the TD ontology file (Turtle) 
  or the TD context file (JSON-LD).
  </p>
  <p>
    The suggested prefix for the TD namespace is <code>td</code>.      
  </p>
  <p>
  The security ontology that can be used with the TD 
  is available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security">https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The data schema ontology that can be used with the TD is 
  available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema">https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema</a>. 
  </p>

  <p class="ednote" title="Binding Vocabulary and Prefixes">
   The TD will reuse existing vocabulary definitions such as for http from the 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/http#">http://www.w3.org/2011/http#</a> namespace. In that case the prefix <code>http</code> is used. However, there are prefixes such as
   <code>coap</code> and <code>mqtt</code> which have no namespace yet. Currently there are efforts to have such namespace representations which will be referenced in the 
   TD specification in the future. In the meantime,  the [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]] provides the list of terms that can be used to specify the protocol metadata in the Thing Description.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
    
      <p>
      The W3C Thing Description provides a set of vocabulary for describing 
      physical and virtual Things. 
      To increase interoperability 
      the vocabulary terms are defined using the 
      Resource Description Framework (RDF). 
      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-vocabulary">
      All vocabulary restrictions noted in these tables MUST be followed, 
      including mandatory items and default values. 
      </span></p>
    
      <p>
      In general, the Thing Description vocabulary set is grouped in three modules: 
      the core Thing Description vocabulary reflecting WoT's paradigm of 
      <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>, 
      and <code>Events</code> (also see [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]); 
      the data schema vocabulary reflecting a subset of the terms defined in 
      JSON Schema [[?JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]] in a 
      linked data representation; 
      and the security vocabulary used to define security mechanism 
      configuration requirements. 
      </p>
     
      <p>
      An overview of this vocabulary with its class context and class relation 
      is given by the following three figures: the TD core model, 
      the TD data schema model, and the TD security model. 
      Please note that the figures reflect the vocabulary terms and structure 
      as they would be used in a Thing Description 
      instance 
      (see Section <a href="#sec-td-serialization"></a>). 
      The full ontology definitions of the different modules 
      can be viewed by following the namespaces as provided in Section 
      <a href="#namespaces"></a>.

      In the figures above, and in the tables to follow, 
      items which have default values are indicated as being optional. 
      However, technically, 
      these are optional <em>only in the JSON serialization</em>. 
      They are actually mandatory parts of the 
      information model and are also mandatory in the JSON-LD serialization. 
      </p>
    
      <p>A detailed description of the vocabulary of the TD core model and 
      TD data schema model is given in the next sub-section.</p>

      <h2>Security Vocabulary Definition</h2>
    
      <p>
      For the core TD vocabulary only well-established security  
      mechanisms are supported, such as those built into protocols supported by WoT  
      or already in wide use with those protocols.  
      The current set of HTTP security schemes is partly based on 
      <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#securitySchemeObject">OpenAPI 3.0.1</a> (see also [[?OPENAPI]]). 
      Note however that while the HTTP security schemes, 
      vocabulary and syntax given in this specification share many similarities 
      with OpenAPI they are not fully compatible.  
      Also, since OpenAPI primarily targets web services built around HTTP, it does not 
      cover the full set of use cases required for the IoT.  
      Security schemes appropriate 
      for IoT-centered protocols such as CoAP and MQTT are therefore also included.
      </p>
    
      <p class="ednote" title="Security Scheme Extensions">
      The vocabulary extension mechanism of the 
      WoT Thing Description allows for additional security schemes if needed.
      However, for more information about what additional security schemes 
      or modifications are under discussion for the core WoT vocabulary
      (and to file issues if you have a request) please visit the

  <h1>Thing Description Serialization</h1>

  <p class="ednote" title="JSON-LD 1.1">
  This is the first draft that uses JSON-LD 1.1 as a serialization format 
  of the Thing Description. 
  As that is work in progress, working assumptions are based on the latest
  <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#">Community Draft of JSON-LD 1.1</a>. 
  A new JSON-LD Working Group has already been
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">chartered</a>.
  It is planned that this section will conform to the latest working draft 
  of their JSON-LD 1.1 deliverable and only use stable elements.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled and structured based on Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>.
  This section defines a TD serialization based on JSON [[!RFC8259]].
  </p>

  <section id="json-serializiation-section">
  <h1>Representation Format</h1>

  <p>
  The JSON serialization of TDs follows the syntax of JSON-LD 1.1
  in order to streamline semantic evaluation.
  Hence, serializations can be parsed either as raw JSON or with a JSON-LD 1.1
  processor.
  </p>

  <p>
  In order to enable this convergence,
  all vocabulary terms defined in Section
  <a href="#sec-core-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  will have a JSON name representation.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition,
  <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-keywords">
  Thing Description instances MAY contain JSON-LD keywords such as
  <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>.</span>
  </p>

  <!--<p>JSON TD MAY contain vocabulary terms that are not in the 
  Thing Description core model. 
  These vocabulary terms MUST carry a prefix for identification 
  within the key name (e.g., "http:header").</p>-->

  <p>
  The data types of the vocabulary as defined in Section
  <a href="#sec-data-schema-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  will be transformed to JSON-based types. 
  The following rules are used for vocabulary terms based on some simple type 
  definitions:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple types string and anyURI
        MUST be serialized as JSON string.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-integer-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type unsignedInt
        MUST be serialized as JSON integer.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-number-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type double
        MUST be serialized as JSON number.
  </span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  All vocabulary terms in Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  associated with more complex class-based types are defined separately for 
  structured JSON type transformation in the following subsections.
  </p>

  <section id="sec-thing-as-a-whole-json">
  <h2>Thing as a whole</h2>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context">
  The root object of a Thing Description instance MAY include the
  <code>@context</code> name from JSON-LD 1.1 with the value URI of 
  the Thing description context file <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code>.
  </span></p>

<pre class="example">
{  
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
    ...
}
</pre>

  <p class="ednote">
  <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code> uses content negotiation to return the
  context file. Thus, it must be fetched with an <code>Accept</code> header set
  to <code>application/ld+json</code>.
  </p>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context-jsonld">
  When a Thing Description instance is processed and interpreted by a
  JSON-LD 1.1 processor the <code>@context</code> member
  MUST be present</span>

  </p>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-additional-contexts">
  When a single Thing Description instance involves several contexts, 
  additional namespaces with prefixes MUST be appended to the 
  <code>@context</code> array structure.</span> 
  This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing 
  Thing Description context without modifying it. For instance:
  </p>
<pre class="example">
{
    "@context": ["http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
                {"iot": "http://iotschema.org/"}],

  as defined in the class <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref"><code>Thing</code></a>

  <!-- should this be "the type" or "the elements of"? -->
  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-objects">
  The type of the members <code>properties</code>, <code>actions</code>, 
  <code>events</code>, <code>version</code>, and <code>securityDefinitions</code> MUST be a JSON object.

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-arrays">
  The type of the members <code>links</code>,
  <code>scopes</code>, and <code>security</code>

  </span></p>

  <p>
  A TD snippet based on the defined members of the class
  <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref"><code>Thing</code></a>

  <p>Alternatively, the same example can be written instead to 
  explicitly include the (semantic) names used by JSON-LD 1.1

    In the following, the <code>nosec</code> scheme for
    the security configuration in the <code>overheating</code> event 
    to indicate no authentication is required.  
    For the <code>status</code> property and the <code>toggle</code>
    action, however, <code>basic</code> authentication is required as defined
    at the top level of the Thing.

      <p>
      Security configurations can also can be specified for different elements
      at the same level.  This may be required for devices that support
      multiple protocols, for example CoAP and HTTP, with support for different
      security mechanisms.  This is also useful when alternative authentication
      mechanisms are allowed.  Here is a TD snippet demonstrating three possible
      ways to access a resource: via HTTPS with basic authentication, via HTTPS
      via digest authentication, or via CoAPS with an API key.
      In other words, 
      the use of multiple security configurations at the same level 
      provides a way to combine security mechanisms an in "OR" fashion.
      In contrast, putting multiple security configurations in the same
      <code>security</code> member combines them in an "AND" fashion, 
      since in that case
      they would all need to be satisfied to allow access to the resource.
      Note that a <code>security</code> declaration is still mandatory at the 
      Thing level.  Here we use a <code>nosec</code> scheme for symmetry
      but could also have used any one of the other ones as it will be
      overridden in each form.

  <p>As another more complex example, OAuth2 makes use of scopes. 
  These are identifiers that 
  may appear in tokens and must match with corresponding identifiers in a resource to allow 
  access to that resource. 
  For example, in the following, the "status" property can be 
  read by users using bearer tokens containing the scope "limited" 
  but the "configure" action can only be 
  used when the interaction is invoked with a token containing the "special" scope. 
  Scopes are not identical to roles but are often associated with them; 
  for example, perhaps only those in an administrative role can perform "special" interactions.
  Tokens can have more than one scope.  
  In this example, an administrator would
  probably be issued tokens with both the "limited" and "special" scopes while ordinary
  users would only be issued tokens with the "limited" scope.

  <h4>Security and Privacy Considerations</h4>
  
  <p>
  In general the security measures taken to protect a WoT 
  system will depend on the threats and attackers that system
  may face and the value of the assets needs to protect.
  A detailed discussion of security and privacy considerations for the Web of Things,
  including a threat model that can be adapted to various circumstances, is
  presented in the informative document [[!WOT-SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS]].  
  This section discusses only security and privacy risks
  and possible mitigations directly relevant to the WoT Thing Description.
  </p>
  <p>A WoT Thing Description can describe both secure and 
  insecure network interfaces.  When a Thing Description is 
  retro-fitted to an existing network interface, no change in the 
  security status of the network interface is to be expected.
  </p>
  <p>
  When designing new devices and services for use with the WoT,
  we have documented a suggested set of best practices
  in [[!WOT-SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES]] to improve security.
  This best-practices document may be updated as security measures evolve.
  Following these practices does not guarantee security, 
  but it at least will help to avoid common known vulnerabilities.
  </p>
  <p>The use of a WoT Thing Description introduces  
  the security and privacy risks given in the following sections.
  After each risk, we suggest some possible mitigations.
  </p>
  <section id="sec-security-consideration-context">
  <h5>Context Dereferencing Privacy Risk</h5>
      <p>Deferencing the vocabulary files given in the <code>@context</code>
          member of any JSON-LD document can be a privacy risk.
          In the case of the WoT, an attacker can observe the network
          traffic produced by such deferences and can use the metadata
          of the dereference, such as the destination IP address,
          to infer information about the device especially if domain-specific
          vocabularies are used.  This is a risk even if the connection
          is encrypted, and is related to DNS privacy leaks.
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Avoid actual dereferencing of vocabulary files.
          Vocabulary files should be cached whenever possible.
          Ideally they would be made immutable, built into the interpreting device,
          and not derefenced at all,
          with the URI in the <code>@context</code> member serving only as 
          an identifier of the (known) vocabulary. 
          This requires the use of strict version control, as updates
          should use a new URI to ensure that existing URIs can refer to 
          immutable data.
          Use well-known standard vocabulary files whenever possible to
          improve the chances that the context file will be available locally
          to systems interpreting the metadata in a Thing Description.
      </dd></dl>
   </section>
   <section id="sec-security-consideration-id">
   <h5>Immutable Identifiers Privacy Risk</h5>
      <p>The fact that a Thing Description contains a unique
          identifier means that should it be associated with
          a person it can be used to track that person and 
          therefore pose a risk to privacy.
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          All identifiers should be mutable,
          and there should be a mechanism to update the <code>id</code>
          of a Thing.
          Specifically,
          the <code>id</code> of a Thing should not be fixed in hardware.
          This does, however, conflict with the Linked Data ideal that
          identifiers are fixed URIs.  In many circumstances it
          will be acceptable to only allow updates to identifiers if
          a Thing is reinitialized.  In this case as a software entity the
          old Thing ceases to exist and a new Thing is created.
          This can be sufficient to break a tracking chain when, for
          example, a device is sold to a new owner.
          Alternatively, if more frequent changes are desired during 
          the operational phase of a device,
          a mechanism can be put into place to notify only authorized users
          of the change in identifier when a change is made.
          Note however that some classes of devices, e.g. medical devices,
          may require immutable IDs by law in some jurisdictions.
          In this case extra attention should be paid to secure 
          access to files, such as Thing Descriptions, containing such
          immutable identifiers.
          </dd></dl>
      </p>
   </section>
   <section id="sec-security-consideration-fingerprint">
   <h5>Fingerprinting Privacy Risk</h5>
      <p>As noted above, the <code>id</code> member in a TD can pose a privacy risk.  
      However, even if the <code>id</code> is updated as described to mitigate its
      tracking risk, it may still be possible to associate
      a TD with a particular physical device, and from there to a person, through fingerprinting.
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Only authorized users should be provided access
          to the Thing Description for a Thing.
          If the TD is only distributed to authorized users 
          through secure and confidential channels, for
          example through a directory service that requires authentication,
          the risk can be minimized.  
      </dd></dl>
   </section>
   <section id="sec-security-consideration-tampering">
   <h5>TD Interception and Tampering Security Risk</h5>
      <p>Intercepting and tampering with TDs can be used to launch man-in-the-middle attacks,
      for example by rewriting URLs in TDs to redirect accesses to a malicious 
      intermediary that can capture or manipulate data.
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Obtain Thing Descriptions only through
          mutually authenticated channels.
          This ensures that the client and the server are both sure of the 
          identity of the other party to the communication.
          This is also necessary in order to deliver TDs only to authorized users.
      </dd></dl>
   </section>
   <section id="sec-security-consideration-tampering">
   <h5>Context Interception and Tampering Security Risk</h5>
      <p>Intercepting and tampering with context files can be used to facilitate attacks
      by modifying the interpretation of vocabulary. 
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
	      Ideally context files would only be obtained through authenticated channels
	      but it is notable (and unfortunate) that many contexts are indicated using
	      HTTP URLs, which are vulnerable to interception and modification if 
	      dereferenced.  However, if context files are immutable and cached, 
	      and dereferencing is avoided whenever possible, then this risk can be reduced.
      </dd></dl>
   </section>
   <section id="sec-security-consideration-inferencing">
   <h5>Inferencing of Personally Identifiable Information Privacy Risk</h5>
      <p>In many locales, in order to protect the privacy of users,
      there are legal requirements for the handling of
      personally identifiable information,
      that is,
      information that can be associated with a particular person.
      Such information can of course be generated by IoT devices directly.
      However,
      the existence and metadata of IoT devices
      (the kind of data stored in a Thing Description)
      can also contain or be used to infer personally identifiable information.
      This information can be as simple as the fact that a certain person owns a certain
      type of device,
      which can lead to additional inferences about that person.
      </p>
      <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Treat a Thing Description associated with a 
	      personal device as if it contained
	      personally identifiable information.
          As an example application of this principle,
          consider how to obtain user consent.  
          Consent for usage of personally identifiable data
          generated by a Thing is often obtained when a Thing is paired with system
          consuming the data,
          which is frequently also when the Thing Description
          is registered with a local directory or the system consuming the 
          Thing Description in order to access the device.
          In this case consent for using data from a Thing can be combined with
          consent for accessing the Thing's Thing Description.
          As a second example, if we consider a TD to contain personally
          identifiable information, then it should not be retained indefinitely
          or used for purposes other than those for which consent was given.
